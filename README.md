# Daibetes-multiple-linear-regression
The objective of this project is to build a multiple linear regression model to understand the relationship between various predictors and diabetes outcomes. By interpreting the regression coefficients and assessing the model fit using the R² value, we gain insights into the factors that significantly impact diabetes.

The dataset includes various features related to patients' health and diabetes measurements, such as:

Age

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Blood Pressure

Serum Insulin

Blood Glucose Levels

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Other relevant health indicators

## Analysis and model
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data and preparing it for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the distributions and relationships between variables.

Multiple Linear Regression: Building and fitting the regression model using multiple predictors.

Model Interpretation: Interpreting the regression coefficients to understand the impact of each predictor.

Model Evaluation: Using R² to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model.

## Key findings
Model Coefficients: Each coefficient in the regression model represents the change in the diabetes outcome for a one-unit change in the predictor, holding other predictors constant.

Significant Predictors: Identification of significant predictors that have a notable impact on diabetes outcomes.

R² Value: The R² value indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R² value suggests a better fit of the model to the observations.
